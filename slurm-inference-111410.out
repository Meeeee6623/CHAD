[2025-04-21 03:12:53,145] [INFO] [real_accelerator.py:239:get_accelerator] Setting ds_accelerator to cuda (auto detect)
Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /home/pl217/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

Loading LoRA adapter from checkpoint: /home/pl217/continualearning/narrativeqa_hat_finetune_3.2_3B_run1/checkpoint-10
Warning: Did not find 'adapter_config.json' in /home/pl217/continualearning/narrativeqa_hat_finetune_3.2_3B_run1/checkpoint-10. This might indicate an issue with the checkpoint saving or that it's not a LoRA checkpoint.
Attempting to load /home/pl217/continualearning/narrativeqa_hat_finetune_3.2_3B_run1/checkpoint-10 as a full model checkpoint instead...
Inference job finished.
